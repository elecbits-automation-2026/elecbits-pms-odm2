/* ─── WHERE EVERY TABLE LIVES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
   One map, one place. Table names used to be string literals scattered across
   three files; when the database was reorganised into schemas that meant
   hunting them down one by one. Now a move is an edit to this file.

   Two schemas matter to this app:

     core   what the whole company shares — people, orgs, projects,
            assignments. The ULM, HR, Finance, Box Build and Product tools
            read the same rows.
     pms    this tool's own working data — tasks, stages, meetings, the
            workspace blob.

   Both must be listed in Supabase → Settings → API → Exposed schemas, or
   PostgREST will answer 404 for everything here.                            */

/* If the database has NOT been reorganised yet — 00-one-structure.sql not run,
   or rolled back — everything still lives in `public` under its old name. The
   app must work either way: a tool that needs its database migration and its
   deploy to land in the same two minutes is a tool that breaks at 4pm on a
   Wednesday. `ensureLayout` probes once per page load and every query then
   goes to wherever the data actually is. */
